# Machine Learning Model and Analysis of Correlation of variables

This Project utilizes machine learning models that are trained to recognize certain types of patterns. An algorithm is provided to a model to help it reason over and learn from a set of data.

The technology stack, tools, and skills required for the project.

Data Mining
A data mining process involves the extraction and discovery of patterns in large data sets using methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems.
